Sheet name and current filter state should automatically save/load from local browser storage.
Sometimes Google's caching sucks and the list doesn't refresh, just uncheck/recheck a box.

EACH BLUE = show only matching filtered items
ANY BLUE ON = always hides unfiltered items
YELLOW = hide item from main list
ORANGE = filter a suffix instead
PURPLE = case-sensitive
" + " = add filter
" trash" = delete filter, requires double click (right click to unclick)
